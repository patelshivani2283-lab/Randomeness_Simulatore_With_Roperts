“Randomness Simulator with Distribution Reports” is a web-based application 
that generates random data using different probability distributions  
such as Uniform, Normal, Binomial, and Poisson.  
The system visualizes the generated data through histograms  
and provides detailed statistical reports including mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.
Users can simulate one distribution or compare two distributions side-by-side.
